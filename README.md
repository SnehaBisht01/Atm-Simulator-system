# Atm-Simulator-system
My first major application, completed in December 2023, was a "Bank Management System ATM Simulator System" developed in Java. This application simulated the functionalities of a real ATM.

Name: Bank Management System ATM Simulator

Functionality: The application allowed users to operate bank accounts by performing various transactions such as account management, deposits, withdrawals, viewing mini statements, and changing PINs, mimicking the operations of a traditional ATM.

Input: User authentication details (card number, PIN), transaction requests (deposit amount, withdrawal amount, PIN change), and account management commands.

Output: Transaction confirmations, updated account balances, mini statements, and successful PIN change notifications.

Stack:

Programming Language: Java for developing the core functionalities and ensuring a robust and secure application.
Database: Integrated a relational database (such as MySQL) to store and manage user account information, transaction histories, and authentication data.
Main Challenges:

Security: Ensuring secure user authentication and safeguarding sensitive information such as account details and PINs.
Transaction Management: Implementing accurate and reliable transaction processing to prevent errors and inconsistencies.
User Interface: Designing an intuitive and user-friendly interface that mimics the look and feel of a real ATM.
Data Integrity: Maintaining data integrity and consistency, especially during concurrent transactions and updates.
Error Handling: Implementing robust error handling to manage scenarios like insufficient funds, incorrect PIN entries, and system errors gracefully.
Overall, the Bank Management System ATM Simulator aimed to provide users with a realistic ATM experience, focusing on essential banking functionalities while ensuring security and reliability.
